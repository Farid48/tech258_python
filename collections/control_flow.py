# Loops

### What are loops? Are the different types? What can you do with them?

# Loops are ways to repeat certain instructions until a criteria is met
# FOR Loops : A list of instructions are given, and when these instructions are finished, that's when the loop ends
# WHILE Loops : While a condition is true / is not true, a certain instruction is completed over and over again until the conditions are met. (This one can break code easily, so make sure to add an exit)

## task 3: While loop
# If there was no increment, no the while loop wouldn't stop and can cause crashes
