# bools and none

# bools can be: True or False

a = True
b = False
#
# print(a == b)
# print(a != b)
# # False = 0 True = 1
# print(a >= b)
# print(a <= b)

# booleans methods

hi = "Hello World"
#
# print(hi.isalpha())
# print(hi.isupper())
# print(hi.islower())
# print(hi.endswith("d"))
# print(hi.startswith("H"))
#
# # Always true unless its empty
# print(bool("a"))

# The Values of NONE
# For objects that don't have a data type (A placeholder)
# none and false aren't the same thing, only if it gets converted into a bool

x = None
print(x == False)
print(x == None)

# None is a placeholder, less likely to cause problems down the line, better than using empty strings and is more memory effient
